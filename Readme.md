mentor_profiles: Contains data specific to mentors (e.g., professional experience, skills).

mentee_profiles: Contains data specific to mentees (e.g., learning objectives, education).

connections: Manages the relationship between a mentor and a mentee (pending, accepted, etc.).

sessions: Stores details about scheduled mentorship sessions, including the Google Meet link.

messages: Contains all real-time chat messages between connected users.

reviews: Stores the ratings and comments for completed sessions, allowing for two-way feedback.

üöÄ Getting Started
This project is fully containerized. To get a local development environment up and running, you will need Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd taetir-project

2. Configure Environment Variables
You must create a .env file in the root of the server directory. You can copy the provided example file to get started:

cp server/.env.example server/.env

Now, open server/.env and fill in your secret keys. You will need credentials for:

Google OAuth: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID and GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET from the Google Cloud Console.

Cloudinary: CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME, CLOUDINARY_API_KEY, and CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET from your Cloudinary dashboard.

3. Build and Run the Containers
From the root directory of the project, run the following command:

docker-compose up --build

This command will:

Build the Docker images for your client and server.

Start all four services (client, server, db, db_cache).

The first time it runs, the db container will automatically execute the init.sql script to create your database schema.

4. Access the Application
Frontend: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173

Backend API: The server is running on http://localhost:5000

Database: The PostgreSQL database is accessible on localhost:5433

You now have a fully functional local development environment with live reloading for both the frontend and backend.
